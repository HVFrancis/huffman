PROJECT TITLE: huffman
This project implements the Huffman Tree from
MATHManiaCS Lesson 2: Text Compression Activity at
http://www.mathmaniacs.org/lessons/02-textcomp/index.html

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To code and decode a string using a specific Huffman Tree
I created this project to help code and decode messages turned in by
my students as part of an assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science
class's unit on text compression.

VERSION or DATE: 2016.11.02

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: This project (currently) required BlueJ to interact with

AUTHORS: Howard V Francis

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

To encode a message, create a HuffMap object, then call its encodeHuffman method

To decode a message, create a HuffTree object, then call its decodeHuffman method
